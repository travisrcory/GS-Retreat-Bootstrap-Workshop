Food
-------------
Most pet rock owners, though not intending to harm them, do not feed their pet rocks. Contrary to popular belief, pet rocks do need food to live a content life. You can feed your pet rock a few drops of water, some dirt, or even a drop or two of oil. To feed your pet, simply rub food onto the rock until it is soaked up, or falls off.

Tricks
-------------

Teaching your pet rock to do tricks not only benefits your pet rock, but can also be very entertaining to you, and your friends and family. Your pet can also be trained using the included treats. Below are some of the most basic tricks a pet rock can learn.


* Sit
* Stay
* Play Dead
* Rock n' Roll
* Attack

Health
-------------
It is truly a terrible thing when you find out that your pet rock is sick. To prevent this, make sure you keep your rock clean, feed your pet regularly, and take them to the vet's office at least once a year.
Enjoy!
-------------
The pet work is truly a fantastic addition to any family. Please enjoy this great investment.
