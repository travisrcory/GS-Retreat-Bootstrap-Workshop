					<strong>Liferay's deployment services</strong>.

					<p>
						As Liferay Portal is used in an extremely broad range of use cases, Liferay Global Services provides professional services engagements for Liferay Portal EE to support many services such as installation, customization, application development, integration, lifecycle management and more. For additional information, contact <a href="mailto:sales@liferay.com">sales@liferay.com</a>. Liferay Global Services can also provide the following recommended services:
					</p>

					<ol type="a">
						<li>
							<strong>Liferay Kick-Start Program</strong>

							<p>
								The early phases of a project include such critical deliverables as information architecture design, capacity planning, high availability design, change management, and more. Unfortunately, many software deployments suffer from improper planning and architectural choices that occurred at the start of their projects. These early missteps can cause delays, increase project costs, and increase complexity for future maintenance and expansion. The <em>Liferay Kick-Start Program</em> allows you to leverage information architecture, strategy, and other technical best practices crafted by the architects and designers of the Liferay product. Customers who leverage these services have a much greater chance of enjoying reduced project costs, achieving project milestones, and reducing execution risk.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<strong>Liferay Go-Live Program</strong>

							<p>
								Architectural complexities, scalability bottlenecks, and missteps in initial design decisions can jeopardize a successful launch and vastly complicate your solution's future support. While many of these scalability and performance issues are best addressed early in a project lifecycle, Liferay Global Services understands the time pressures faced by many of our clients and how these non-functional requirements are often delayed until shortly before launch. To help improve launch-time scalability and prevent performance issues, Liferay Global Services offers Enterprise Subscription customers the <em>Liferay Go-Live Program</em>.
